Mann Robotics was first started in the 2014-2015 season: VEX Robotics Competition Skyrise, with only a single team of a few students. Since then, we have grown enormously in both membership and success. Ever since StarStruck (2016-2017), we've had 100% qualification to the State Tournament, even sending 3796C, our all-girls team, to the 2018 VEX Robotics World Championship in Louisville, KY, where they recieved a divisional Innovate Award.

### Skyrise (2014-2015)
Skyrise was the founding year for Mann Robotics and its first team, now 3796A Mann Made. Mann Made went to only one competition that year, and just barely got off the ground. Because they did not qualify for the state tournament, their season ended in November. 

### Nothing But Net (2015-2016)
With the new season came a new team: 3796B Some Assembly Required. Composed of only four people: Tyler Mulea, Francis Villanueva, and Patrick & Brendan McGuire, this team worked hard, and at our very first self-hosted competition, they won the skills award, qualifying them as the first Mann Robotics team to compete at the state tournament. This was quite the learning experience, and 3796B struggled to get ready for the tournament only a few weeks away.

On March 12, 2016, 3796B competed at the South Carolina VRC State Tournament held at River Bluff High School in Lexington, South Carolina. While they weren't extremely competitive at the tournament, it was a great learning experience and meaningful for the organization as a whole. 3796B went 3-3-0, and did not make eliminations.

### StarStruck (2016-2017)
We got another new team in StarStruck, 3796C Don't Forget to Breathe (then called Flower Power), our all-girls team. For the other teams, StarStruck was a year of change. The first competition we went to, The Viking Guantlet Challenge, did not go well. We had made some wrong assumptions
