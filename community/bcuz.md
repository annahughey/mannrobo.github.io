You can learn more about [BCUZ](https://bcuzrobotics.com) on their website.

The BCUZ VEXU team is largely comprised of former HS competitors, mainly from South Carolina. Their alumnus teams include 8926, 29601R, 675A, 1958A, and 67864D. Through the [VEX Teams of South Carolina](https://discord.gg/W9EcfQW/) Discord Server, Mann Robotics is able to connect with them, and learn from their experience.

BCUZ and Mann Robotics have collaborated in the past, especially in volunteering for events, especially the Falcon's Middle School Qualifier.
