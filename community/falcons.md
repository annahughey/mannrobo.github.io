Community involvement is important to Mann Robotics. Keeping with this spirit, this year, Mann Robotics has implemented a mentorship program of sorts to assist Sevier Middle School's 8 teams (8686B, 8686G, 8686H, 8686J, 8686K, 8686M, 8686N, and 8686P)

In past years, Mann Robotics has worked with Clemson's VEXU team BCUZ to volunteer at Sevier's Falcon's Middle School Qualifier, and will be doing so again this year
