Congratulations to 3796C, Don't Forget to Breathe for winning the Innovate Award in the Math Division! Judges at VEX Worlds 2018 applauded the all-girls team for their unique and innovative approach to the design challenge this year.

We look forward to seeing their unique design for the new challenge: Turning Point! 3796C and the rest of Mann Robotics will first appear at our fall qualifier on November 17th.
